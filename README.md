# The Useless Drive
The useless box but with your optical disk drive, try to keep it closed ;) (also only use this on tray loading drives, please dont ever use this on slot loading ones, and also dont do this too much as it can damage the drive hehe)

Compile with:
```
gcc main.c -o tud
```
And just run it with:
```
./tud
```
